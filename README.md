# Health + OpenStreetMap

A repository for general health-related work through the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. Most conversations will happen within a specific project repo, but this is place for notes and ideas. Chat happens on the HOT Slack ([sign up here](https://hotosm-slack.herokuapp.com/)) as well as on Gitter ([health room](https://gitter.im/hotosm/health)). 

Open an issue with a question or idea.
